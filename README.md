# Tech Stack

## 1. Expo

Expo is a set of tools and services for building, deploying, and managing React Native applications. It provides an easier and faster way to develop cross-platform mobile applications using React Native.

### Advantages of Expo

- **Streamlined Development Process:** It simplifies common tasks such as project setup, configuration, and building, allowing developers to focus more on writing code and less on setup and configuration.

- **Cross-Platform Development:** Expo allows developers to build cross-platform mobile applications that run on both iOS and Android devices using a single codebase. This enables faster development and easier maintenance compared to developing separate codebases for each platform.

- **Access to Native APIs:** Expo provides access to a wide range of native APIs and device features, allowing developers to incorporate features such as camera, location, push notifications, and more into their applications without needing to write native code or use third-party libraries.

- **Community and Ecosystem:** Expo has a large and active community of developers and contributors, as well as a growing ecosystem of third-party libraries, tools, and services that integrate seamlessly with Expo projects.

- **Simplified Deployment:** Expo provides a straightforward process for deploying applications to app stores, including built-in support for generating and managing app signing certificates, as well as automated builds and deployments through the Expo CLI or Expo's web-based build service.

## 2. React Native

React Native is an open-source framework for building mobile applications developed by Facebook. It allows developers to build mobile apps using JavaScript and React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React Native enables developers to write code once and deploy it across multiple platforms, including iOS and Android, without sacrificing performance or user experience.

- **Reusable Components:** React Native encourages the use of reusable UI components, which can be shared across different parts of the application or even between different projects. This promotes code reusability and improves development efficiency.

- **Large Community and Ecosystem:** React Native has a large and active community of developers, contributors, and third-party libraries. This provides developers with access to a wealth of resources, tutorials, and support, as well as a wide range of pre-built components and tools to accelerate development.

# Suggestions

## Recommendations for Improvement

Mobile devices are primarily operated through touch, so the UI should be designed with touch interactions in mind. Touch targets must be sized appropriately, visual feedback for touch events must be provided, and small interactive elements must not be used.
